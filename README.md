# Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to extract meaningful information from images, videos, and take action based on that information. Simply it is a field of study to develop methods to help computer to "see" and understand the content of images and videos. It is an interesting subject for research since decades and the decades of researech results are the diferent deep learning computer vision algorithms.

## Aplications
Use cases of computer vision are not limited to any specific field. Examples of computer vision applications are : 
- Assisting humans in identification
- Automatic inspection
- Automotives and driverless vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis

## Tasks
Each of application area of computer vision consists of a range of computer vision tasks. Example of some of the computer vision task are : 
- Image or Object Detection and Recognition
- Object Segmentation
- Image Retrieval
- Optical Character Recognition
- Object Tracking
- Scene Reconstruction
